    <h3>Once Upon a Time </h3>

    <div className="text">
      <p>
        We met on Thursday August 28<sup>th</sup>, 2015 while attending the
        freshmen Connect retreat at St. Mary’s Catholic Student Center in
        Aggieland. When the retreat began, we both wanted to make friends and
        get involved at St. Mary’s. Little did we know that our connection from
        our small group table would last a lifetime. Fast forward and we are now
        getting married five years and one day after meeting.

        It is said that if a couple walks under the Century Tree together, they
        will be together forever. What better place to ask the one he loves?
        After lots of planning and some help from some friends, Joseph got down
        on one knee and Savannah said yes to forever together.
